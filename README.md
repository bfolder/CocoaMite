### Installation

Installing CocoaMite is pretty straightforward if you have CocoaPods installed.

Step 1: Add the CocoaMite dependency to your podfile:

```Ruby
pod 'CocoaMite'
```

Step 2: Include the header:

`#import "CocoaMite.h"`

Step 3: Initialize and setup the CocoaMite client:

```objc
CocoaMite *client = [[CocoaMite alloc] initWithApiKey: @"YOUR_KEY" subdomain: @"YOUR_SUBDOMAIN"];
```

If you happen to clone this repository, don't forget to update corresponding submodules.

### Problems?!

In order to run CocoaMite you need to activate api access inside your mite account settings. (More info [here](http://mite.yo.lk/en/api/basics.html "more info"))  

If you want to play with the example and tests, fill in your personal api key & subdomain (Tests: Define.h / Example: AppDelegate.m).

### Usage

As mentioned at the beginning, CocoaMite is just a wrapper around the public REST api. Take a look at the header file to get an idea of what the wrapper is capable of. Most of the comments are derived from the mite api documentation. 

### Todos (10/9/13)

* The included iOS example needs to be reworked (or rather 'extended').
* Mac example
* Further documentation
